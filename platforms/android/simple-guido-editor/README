This sample application is composed of three tabs :
 - the first, to type gmncode
 - the second, to draw score in web view with a svg representation of the score
 - the third, to draw score in a canvas with canvas-draw-command library

To build and run this sample application you have to :

1- run ndk-build in ../guido-engine-jni-android, copy the content of directory ../guido-engine-jni-android/libs to a new directory ./libs of this project

2- Compile jni package. Go to guidolib-code/lang/java and follow instruction. 
	Copy the generated jar (guidoengine-android.jar and drawcommand.jar) in the ./libs directory of this project.

3- Go to ../canvas-draw-command/ and follow instruction to compile canvas-draw-command.jar 
	Add this jar in in the ./libs directory of this project.

4- Copy android-support-v4.jar in the ./libs directory of this project.
	

Then execute (if you're not using any IDE)
  android update project -p .
  ant debug
  adb install -r bin/SimpleGuidoEditor-debug.apk

Make sure you have the sdk installed, java development tools, an emulator up and running that is recognized by adb.
