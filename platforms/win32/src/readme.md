## Windows native devices

This folder contains the following native devices:

- GDI
- GDI Plus
- Direct2D

The Direct2D device has been designed by Michael Chourdakis. It's design differs from the other implementations: all the required classes are implemented inline in a single file. In addition, it requires the Active Template Library (ATL) to be compiled.
