Welcome to the Guido project
======================================================================

[Grame](http://www.grame.fr) - Centre National de Création Musicale
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Guido project is an open source project that encompasses a music notation format, a score rendering engine and various music score utilities. The Guido Notation Format is a general purpose formal language for representing score-level music in a platform-independent plain text and human readable way. The format comes with various software components for music score rendering and manipulation. The main of these components is the Guido Engine, a library embedable in various platforms and using different programming languages.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

## IMPORTANT NOTE

Before using the Guido tools, **you need to install the `guido2.ttf` font in your system**.
The font is located in the `share/font/guido` folder. Double click the `guido2.ttf` file will generally open your system font manager. Next, you'll only have to follow instructions.

## Acknowledgments

The Guido project has been initiated in the 90s by Holger Hoos, Jürgen Kilian and Kai Renz, who designed the Guido Music Notation format and developped the core of the Guido engine. It became an open source library in 2002 at the initiative of the Grame Computer Music Research Lab. Since then, many people have been contributing to the Guido library project.
I would like to thank them and especially:
