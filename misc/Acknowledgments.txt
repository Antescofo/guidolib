The Guido project originates from Ph.D.s conducted by Holger Hoos, Kai Renz and 
Jürgen Kilian at the TU Darmstadt.
The Guido engine has been designed by Kai Renz. It became an open source library in 
December 2002 at the initiative of the Grame Computer Music Research Lab. Since then,
many persons have been contributing to the Guido library project.
I would like to thank them and especially: 
J. Scott Amort, Jérôme Berthet, Samuel Brochot, Martin Carlé, Yannick Chapuis, Thomas Coffy, 
Christophe Daudin, Colas Decron, Guillaume Gouilloux, Torben Hohn, Camille Le Roi, 
François Levy, Arnaud Margaillan, Benjamen Ruprechter, Mike Solomon
and of course, my colleagues and friends Stéphane Letz and Yann Orlarey
