After a ndk-build in ../guido-engine-android, copy the content of directory ../guido-engine-android/libs to a new directory ./libs

Generate guidoengine.jar using the root README, section "Note for Android"

Then execute (if you're not using any IDE)
  android update project -p .
  ant debug
  adb install -r bin/SimpleGuidoEditor-debug.apk

Make sure you have the sdk installed, java development tools, an emulator up and running that is recognized by adb.

**** For now, guidoengine.drawcommand package is not embedded in guidoengine.jar. To compile simple guido editor, you have to delete all references to it ****
