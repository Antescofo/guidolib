From this directory, run:

  ndk-build
  ant debug
  adb install -r bin/HelloWorldGuido-debug.apk

Make sure that ndk-build (ships with the NDK, should be in the bin/
directory), ant (Apache ant, http://ant.apache.org/) and adb
fromt the android sdk are in your path. Also, make sure you have an emulator
up and running that is recognized by adb.
