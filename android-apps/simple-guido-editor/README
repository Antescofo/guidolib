Edit jni/Android.mk to point to your cairo and pixman locations. Make sure
cairo and pixman are compiled for android. Also make sure to build
GUIDOEngine for android (see ../readme.txt) and to install this
to the jni directory of this project.

Then, from the android directory

ndk-build
ant debug
adb install -r bin/HelloWorldGuido-debug.apk

Make sure that ndk-build (ships with the NDK, should be in the bin/
directory), ant (Apache ant, http://ant.apache.org/) and adb
fromt the android sdk are in your path. Also, make sure you have an emulator
up and running that is recognized by adb.
