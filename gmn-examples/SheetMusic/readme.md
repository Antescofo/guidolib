Sheet Music
======================================================================

[Sheet Music](http://www.sheetmusic-kreidler.com/) is a conceptual work by [Johannes Kreidler](http://kreidler-net.de/)

Sheet Music cannot be listened to or deciphered. It is a book of imaginary solf√®ge, a new form of visual poetry where the effects of signs are no longer sounds but their own image.

The GMN files included in this folder are intended to demonstrate the flexibility of the Guido Engine. It's currently a work in progress: only the beginning of the book has been encoded in [Guido Music Notation](https://guidodoc.grame.fr).
