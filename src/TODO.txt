Make GuidoEngine reentrant 
==========================

When GuidoEngine will be reentrant, the webservice HTTPDServer::start can be modified. The MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY property use a single thread for all connections and can be replace by a multithread option like MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION or MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY or other.

 * Remove all global variables
- mMaxTagId : can be integrated to ARMusicalVoice.
- gArMusic
- gCurStaff
- gCurMusic
- gCurSystem
- gClipRect

 * Done : 
- GuidoPageFormat and GuidoLayoutSettings have been modified to be integrated in the class. The GuidoAR2GRParameterized method take the two data structure and can be used safely.
