Mac:

- some manual steps in between are still left out, e.g. to copy the resulting libraries from one project to the next -> TODO automate this
- a number of directories/include paths are set manually in files, and will change on a different system - these paths need to be changed, or better yet, made system-independent)

1) compile and install PySide and dependencies (including shiboken)
- cd pyside-sources

- (if you dare you can update from git, but then unexpected things might happen, as I had to patch some files!)

- if error "Symbol not found: __cg_jpeg_resync_to_restart":
sudo mv /Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/libJPEG-test.dylib /Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/libJPEG.use-system-lib.dylib

- if error "Symbol not found: __cg_png_create_info_struct":
sudo mv /Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/libPng.dylib /Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/libPng.use-system-lib.dylib

- source environment.sh
- sudo ./build_and_install


Win:

1a) Qt
see http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/2011/02/01/how-to-compile-qt-4-7-with-visual-studio-2010/

1b) PySide
follow official instructions:
http://qt-project.org/wiki/Building_PySide_on_Windows

e.g. in my case:
##
cd C:\pyside-setup
python setup.py bdist_wininst --qmake=C:\Qt\4.7.4\bin\qmake.exe --openssl=C:\OpenSSL-Win64\bin
##

note: make sure there are no spaces in filenames! :-)
