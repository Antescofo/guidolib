PyGuido
=======

PyGuido provides Python binding for the GUIDO Engine Library (GUIDOLib), available at http://guidolib.sourceforge.net. It has been created by Benjamin Rupprechter in 2012.

Currently, the available platforms are:

- Mac OS X (10.6, 10.7) 64-bit

- Windows 7 64-bit

- Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit

Note that not all functionality has been tested yet, so some things might or might not work. Comments and contributions are welcome.


Installation Notes
==================

Windows
-------

- Visual Studio 2010
- Python 2.7, 64-bit (tested with EPD 7.3-2 64-bit)
- Qt 4.7.4 SDK (you may need to compile this yourself)
- PySide (you may need to compile this yourself)

Please check PyGuido/CMakeLists.txt - you may need to adjust some paths.

in Visual Studio x64 Win64 (2010) Command Prompt:
##
cd cmake
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" ..
msbuild PyGuido.sln /property:Configuration=Release
##


Mac OSX
-------

- XCode 4
- Python 2.7, 64-bit (tested with EPD 7.3-2 64-bit)
- Qt 4.7.4 SDK (you may need to compile this yourself)
- PySide (you may need to compile this yourself)

cd cmake
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Xcode" ..
xcodebuild -project PyGuido.xcodeproj -configuration Release

Linux
-----

cd cmake
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make


Notes
-----

- If you get an error message like "error: no ‘const QMetaObject* QGuidoWidgetWrapper::metaObject() const’ member function declared in class ‘QGuidoWidgetWrapper’", try to run cmake with the argument "-DFIX_METAOBJECT_HEADER_ERROR=1". This patches some header files that seem to be incorrectly generated by shiboken. Note that sed (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) needs to be installed for this to work.
