PyGuido provides Python binding for the GUIDO Engine Library (GUIDOLib), available at http://guidolib.sourceforge.net. It has been created by Benjamin Rupprechter in 2012.

Currently, the available platforms are:

- Mac OS X (10.6, 10.7) 64-bit

- Windows 7 64-bit

Note that not all functionality has been tested yet, so some things might or might not work. Comments and contributions are welcome.
