(*
	This script was crashing due the ugly implementation of the way notes are parsed in a tremolo.
	The crash occured in setAccidental method and was triggered by the flat.
	Actually and to parse the pitch attribute of tremolo, a derived parser is created, that makes use 
	of a derived factory. But this factory declares its own state and may use the inherited state 
	in an uninitialized context.
	The problem has been fixed with a setAccidental method running in the correct derived factory
	context. The whole implementation should be revised.
