# Guido Engine

## Javascript Engine Examples

This folder contains examples that illustrate the use of the Javascript Guido Engine.
Note that these examples assume to find the compiled WASM library (libGUIDOEngine.js and libGUIDOEngine.wasm) at the root of the `javascript` folder.

Compiling the WASM library requires to have the emsdk tools [installed](https://search.lilo.org/results.php?q=emsdk+install).   
Note that you can also get the library from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grame/guidolib) (requires to have node.js and npm installed)

### Unsupported

The `unsupported` folder contains alternate uses of the engine. They rely on different graphic devices (canvas, binary).
These examples are likely not working any more. Note that they have been designed to be placed at the root of the `example` folder.
